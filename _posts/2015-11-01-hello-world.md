Hello, I'm Yuxiang Zhu, a programmer working on free software. From today, I will keep my technical experience and knowledge in this blog and share to everyone.

This blog is built by [Jekyll][], an open software that transforms plain text into static websites and blogs. It is awesome and free to use. If you want to build a blog like me, you can follow instructions on Jekyll's homepage. The theme of this site is adapted from [Freelancer][].
